# Calculator Guide

## How to use the <AppIcon name docs />

<AppIcon name docs /> is like your friendly financial translator! Here's what it
can understand:

### Numbers and Currency Talk

- **Numbers without a symbol:** These are automatically implied to be your base currency.

<CalculatorBlock hideButtons small preset='1000' />

**Numbers with a symbol:** - Include the currency symbol ($, €) before the
number (e.g., `$20.50`, `€10`) and <AppIcon name docs /> will automatically understand it. You can even include a space!

<CalculatorBlock hideButtons small preset='$1000' />

- **Numbers with a currency code:** Numbers with a 3 letter currency code like
  (`EUR`, `USD`, `EGP`) before **or** after the number. -

  <AppIcon name docs /> even fixes typos! So `USD100`, `$ 100`, `10usd`, `10 uSd`,
  `usD100` are all fine.

- **Large Numbers:** You want to write out `11650000`, but your eyes will hurt,
  so you can use symbols followed by a space (e.g., `10k` for ten thousand,
  `10m for ten million`). In this case `11.65m` will represent the number above.
- **Write them verbally** (e.g., `10 thousand`). In this case `11.65 million` will
  represent the example number above.
  - Supported symbols for <AppIcon name docs />:
    - `k`: Thousand (`1,000`)
